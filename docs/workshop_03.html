  </div>
  <div>
    This morning we are going to complete two exercises from <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/code-creative-medium">Code as a Creative Medium</a>, which was written by <a href="http://tegabrain.com">Tega Brain</a> and <a href=" http://golanlevin.com">Golan Levin</a>. I'd really recommend picking up a copy if you can, it's full of brilliant reference, exercises and project briefs.
  </div>
  <div>Before we work on the two exercises, I'd like to show you three important sources of information about p5.js: the forum, the reference and the examples.</div>
  <div>
    Let's take a look at the
    <a href="https://discourse.processing.org/c/p5js/10">p5.js forum</a>. What can we find? Let's try searching for things as well as browsing.
  </div>
  <div>
    Next, let's take a look at the
    <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/">p5.js reference</a> - I always have this open when I'm writing code. Don't forget that all the code examples are editable right in your browser! Even on mobile!
  </div>
  <div>
    Finally, let's take a look at the <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/">p5.js examples</a> - let's try cut and pasting them into new sketches using your new p5.js editor login. Do they work? Why did you pick the ones that you did?
  </div>
  <div>
    Now that we are familiar with the forum, reference and examples, let's try two exercises from <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/code-creative-medium">Code as a Creative Medium</a>: "Drawing Your Initials" and "Draw, then Code".</div>
  <div>By the way, as a reminder, make these exercises on the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org">online p5.js editor at https://editor.p5js.org</a> (don't forget to log in with your GitHub name and password!) - much easier for sharing with others and a nice way of building up a portfolio of p5.js sketches.</div>
  <div>
    Let's discuss "Drawing Your Initials" before we all try it on our own. How should we tackle this? One thing I love to do is use something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode">pseudocode</a> to rough out my ideas as comments before I write any code (thanks for the suggestion Rocio!). That way I can think before I start writing any code. I also love to sketch ideas with my pen and pad before I code. Both are allowed and ecournaged! Let's spend half the remaining time on this exercise before moving onto "Draw, then Code". Show the PDF Joel!
