  <div>
    This morning we are going to complete two exercises from <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/code-creative-medium">Code as a Creative Medium</a>, which was written by <a href="http://tegabrain.com">Tega Brain</a> and <a href=" http://golanlevin.com">Golan Levin</a>. As I said yesterday, the day before and the day before that, I'd really recommend picking up a copy if you can, it's full of brilliant reference, exercises and project briefs.
  </div>
  <div>
    This morning we are going to have 40 minutes for the first exercise, with 40 minutes for the second exercise.
  </div>
  <div>A reminder from yesterday, the day before and the day before that: make these exercises on the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org">online p5.js editor at https://editor.p5js.org</a> - easier for sharing with others and a nice way of building up a portfolio of p5.js sketches.</div>
  <div>
    Let's discuss "Butt Generator" before we all try it on our own on the p5.js editor. Any suggestions? This exercise was inspired by the following project by Le Wei: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/the-bearable-lightness-of-buttgeneratorcom/281508/">https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/the-bearable-lightness-of-buttgeneratorcom/281508/</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    Now let's spend our last 45 minutes workong on plotting a circle using just sin() and cos() functions. This exercise was inspirted by the following project by Yuki Yoshida: <a href="https://github.com/yukiy/drawCircle">https://github.com/yukiy/drawCircle</a>.

    Thanks! Time for a short break!
