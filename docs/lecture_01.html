  <div>What is the <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/creative-computing-institute">Creative Computing Institute (CCI)</a>?</div>
  <div>What you are going to learn in this Intensive.</div>
  <div>We are going to learn about Creative Computing - a blend of Computational Thinking and Creative Coding.</div>
  <div>What is Computational Thinking?</div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>To learn how see problems at many levels (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction">abstraction</a>), break down problems (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_(computer_science)">decomposition</a>), find the order in them (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_(psychology)">pattern recognition</a>), make solutions using a series of steps (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a>) and realise that you might be able to use that solution in lots of areas (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization">generalisation</a>).</li>
      <li>Most of all, to <b>learn</b> how to be <b>autodidacts</b>.</li>
      <li>First task: <b>what</b> is an <b>autodidact</b>? </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Look it up! What did you find?</div>
  <div>What is Creative Coding?</div>
  <div>I believe all coding is creative, as all life is creative. Specifically, creative coding is about blending creative techniques with software engineering. I want you to learn how to write code but also how you could use computing to change your practice. You can make lots of earth credits writing software, but I'm much more interested in giving you the tools to change yourself, your practice and the world.</div>
  <div>Next, a really important diagram.</div>
  <div>
    <img src="images/JimCampbellFormula_for_computer_art.jpg" />
    <div><a href="https://jimcampbell.tv/">Jim Campbell</a>'s formula for Computer Art. Realise that you can use things without understanding every aspect of them. All that computers do is process inputs into outputs. That's it.</div>
  </div>
  <div>But what are we going to learn?</div>
  <div>
    <div>We are going to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, which is <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology-most-popular-technologies">the most commonly used programming language in the world</a>.</div>
  </div>
  <div>
    Some inspiration for the things you can make with JavaScript:

      <li><a href="https://scroobly.com/">Sketch a doodle and have it map to your body in real time</a>!</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    We are going to learn JavaScript using a library called <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>. A library is just a collection of code. <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> was specifically designed as a great way for designers, artists and others to learn to code. It was originally created by <a href="http://www.lauren-mccarthy.com/">Lauren McCarthy</a> but now has <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/#contributors">many contributors</a>. p5.js emerged out of another project: <a href="https://www.processing.org/overview/">Processing</a>.
  </div>
  <div>Let's watch the (interactive) presentation about p5.js at <a href="http://hello.p5js.org">hello.p5js.org</a>.</div>
  <div>Other coding resources and teachers of Creative Coding</div>
  <div>
    Some useful general JavaScript coding resources:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://blog.glitch.com/post/website-starter-kit">A free, 4-part video course with interactive code examples to learn how to make a website using HTML, JS, CSS and Node.js.</a>. <a href="https://blog.glitch.com/post/you-got-this-zine">A free, 20-page zine about making web apps with Node.js.</a> from the same team at Glitch.com. <a href="https://blog.glitch.com/post/party-time">A Party Starter Kit if you want to make a party</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/JavaScript-basics">JavaScript basics</a> from the <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki">p5.js wiki</a> - a good place to refer back to while we are doing this course, with a bit of the history of JavaScript at the start.</li>
      <li><a href="https://jsforcats.com/">JavaScript for Cats</a> - great intro tutorial to JavaScript that you can do right in your browser.</li>
      <li><a href="https://javascript.info">The Modern JavaScript Tutorial</a> - a crowd sourced tutorial that is contantly being updated. Comprehensive series of tutorials and exercises on every aspect of modern JavaScript.</li>
      <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">Mozilla Developer Network JavaScript reference</a> - series of tutorials and references from Mozilla, the maker of Firefox.</li>
      <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> is an online forum for developers using many different languages. It's possible to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript">search by JavaScript only</a>, or even <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/p5.js">p5.js only</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    Some useful p5.js coding resources:
    <ul>
      <li>A good place to start your p5.js learning journey is the <a href="https://p5js.org/get-started/">Get Started</a> tutorial. The <a href="https://p5js.org/learn/">learn section</a> has a series of tutorials. The <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/">examples section</a> is full of real examples to copy from - that's how I usually start a new project - by duplicating an existing project. When I'm writing p5.js, I <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/">always have the reference open</a> so that I can refer to it constantly. Finally, <a href="https://discourse.processing.org/c/p5js/10">p5.js forum</a> is a great place to ask questions and find other learners. I <a href="https://discourse.processing.org/u/jgl">use it all the time</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://natureofcode.com/">The Nature of Code</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/thecodingtrain/">The Coding Train</a> both by <a href="https://shiffman.net/">Daniel Shiffman</a>. <a href="https://natureofcode.com/">The Nature of Code</a> is completely free if you put the price to $0. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/thecodingtrain/">The Coding Train</a> is a brilliant YouTube channel that has amazing creative coding content. I'd really, <i>really</i>, <b>really</b> recommend Daniel's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA">Code! Programming with p5.js</a> playlist.</li>

    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>I found <a href="https://github.com/bmoren/p5js-cheat-sheet">a great p5.js cheat sheet for beginners!</a> I really recommend downloading this in your favourite human language and saving it to your desktop.</div>
